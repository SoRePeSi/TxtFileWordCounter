# TxtFileWordCounter



 Personal project: counts words from all txt files in a folder and stores a writing log each time it is used. 
 
 - Add paths to target folders (Program.cs line 8) and specific target files (Program.cs line 10 and log file (Program.cs line 12) and run Program.cs to count.

 - Specific files contained in target folders will not be counted twice.

 - First line of log will have date 0/0/0. Do not alter it unless more than two log lines exist.

 - Do not alter log structure. We're working with .txt's here.

 - Changing computer date format messes with new logs. This may be fixed in a future update.
